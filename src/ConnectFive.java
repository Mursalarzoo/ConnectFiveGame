This program is written by Mursal Hosseini - December 14th 2022

Requirements for the game:
- A game board consisting of 9 columns and 6 rows.
- Two players taking turns placing a piece by indicating a column.
- A number of pieces to be placed in the columns.
- A routine that automatically fills the two outer columns at the beginning of a game
